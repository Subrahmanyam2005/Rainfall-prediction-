# Rainfall-prediction-
Rainfall prediction using Machine Learning
I‚Äôve reviewed the start of your notebook ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **Rainfall Prediction Project** using Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, machine learning models (SVM, XGBoost, Logistic Regression), and oversampling for imbalanced data.

I can now prepare a **professional GitHub-ready README.md** for your repository.
Here‚Äôs the detailed version:

# üåß Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning

## üìå Overview

This project aims to **predict rainfall** using historical weather data and machine learning techniques. The workflow involves **data preprocessing**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **feature scaling**, and **model training** using multiple algorithms to compare performance.

The goal is to build a **reliable prediction model** that can help farmers, environmental agencies, and disaster management authorities make informed decisions.

## üìÇ Dataset

* **File:** `Rainfall.csv`
* **Description:** The dataset contains meteorological features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other weather conditions.
* **Target Variable:** `RainToday` / `RainTomorrow` (depending on dataset format).
* **Size:** Rows & columns as per dataset.
* **Source:** Public weather dataset (e.g., Bureau of Meteorology or similar).

## üõ† Tech Stack

* **Programming Language:** Python üêç
* **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Machine Learning Models:**

  * Logistic Regression
  * Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
  * XGBoost Classifier
* **Data Preprocessing:**

  * StandardScaler (for normalization)

## üîç Project Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Loading

* Imported the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
* Previewed the first few rows to understand the structure.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Exploration & Cleaning

* Checked dataset size and column types.
* Handled missing/null values.
* Encoded categorical features into numerical form.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Visualized rainfall distribution.
* Plotted relationships between rainfall and weather parameters.
* Used heatmaps to identify correlations.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Scaling

* Applied **StandardScaler** to normalize numerical data.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Handling Imbalanced Data

* Used **RandomOverSampler** from imbalanced-learn to ensure balanced class distribution.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Model Building

* **Logistic Regression** for baseline model.
* **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** for classification.
* **XGBoost Classifier** for improved accuracy and handling non-linearities.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation

* Compared models using accuracy scores and classification reports.
* Visualized results with confusion matrices.

## üìä Results & Insights

* The **XGBoost Classifier** achieved the highest accuracy among all models.
* Oversampling significantly improved model performance by addressing class imbalance.
* Temperature, humidity, and wind speed were key influencing factors for rainfall prediction.

## üöÄ How to Run This Project Locally

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn imbalanced-learn xgboost
```

### Steps

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rainfall-prediction.git
   cd rainfall-prediction
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook

   ```bash

Do you want me to also **add attractive Markdown tables & performance graphs** into this README so it looks visually appealing on GitHub? That would make your repo stand out more.
